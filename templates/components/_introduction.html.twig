<h2 class="introduction-title text-primary">Concept</h2>
<p class="fs-4 text-dark">I show off my cats, you get to enjoy their silly little faces and antics, but also vote for them in
the bloody competition of the cat of the month ! Everyone is happy (?).</p>
<p class="fs-4 text-dark">
The winner gets nothing in particular IRL though. There is no benefits for them. Iâ€™m teaching them 
what real life is. Sorry kids.</p>
<h2 class="introduction-title text-primary">The voting</h2>
<p class="fs-4 text-dark">The voting is quite simple : I give you a few comments about how the cat is doing this month, their good and bad points, and you rate them on a 5 stars system. The one with the best score at the end of the month gets to have their face on the front page. 
The score is then reset, of course.</p>
<h2 class="introduction-title text-primary">Why</h2>
<p class="fs-4 text-dark">why not.</p>
